## Applied simple ML on the snake game

This is a project to explore the posibilities of ML. Using a small & simple ML lib to create a neural network. 
Utilizing the NEAT algorithm to evolve the snakes. 
Improvements to be done: 
- Mutate the top 6 species and merge their brains. 
- Make snake more aware of its surroundings. 
- Pixel input instead of distance input.
